* Scanner: scan documents and images with Emacs

  Scan documents and images using =scanimage(1)= from the SANE distribution
  and =tesseract(1)= for OCR and PDF export.

  The scanner package uses two sets of customizations for image mode and
  document mode, with the former usually configured to use high resolution and
  an image file format, like JPEG, and the latter to use lower resolution and
  a document format, like PDF or text.  The available file formats are
  provided by =scanimage(1)= for image mode and =tesseract(1)= for document
  mode.  The scanner package uses =tesseract(1)= to provide optical character
  recognition (OCR).  You can select the language plugins with
  =scanner-tesseract-languages=.  See also the remark about the data
  directories below.

  In document mode, you can scan one or multiple pages that are then written
  in a customizable output format, e.g. (searchable) PDF or text, or whatever
  tesseract provides.  You can also customize resolution, intermediate image
  format, and paper size.  The command =scanner-scan-document= starts a
  document scan.  Without a prefix argument, it scans one page.  With a
  non-numeric argument, it asks the user after each scanned page for
  confirmation to scan another page.  With a numeric argument, it scans that
  many pages.  In the latter case, it observes a delay between scans that is
  customizable using =scanner-scan-delay=.

  The =scanner-scan-image= command performs one scan or multiple scans in
  image mode.  This function tries to guess the file format from the chosen
  file name or falls back to the configured default, see
  =scanner-image-format=.  The prefix argument works as in document mode.

  The scanning commands are also available in the Tools->Scanner menu.

  For both images and documents, you can customize the scan mode (e.g. "Color"
  or "Gray") if your scanning device supports it.

  You can pass additional options to the backends using the customization
  variables =scanner-scanimage-switches= and =scanner-tesseract-switches=.
  The former variable is helpful for tuning brightness and contrast, for
  instance.

  Finally, the customization options =scanner-tessdata-dir= and
  =scanner-tessdata-configdir= must be set to point to tesseract's data
  directory containing the language definitions (usually something like
  =/usr/share/tessdata/=) and tesseract's configs directory containing the
  output configurations (usually something like
  =/usr/share/tessdata/configs/=).


  
* Bugs

  - This package doesn't support document feeders yet.
  - This package doesn't support authentication.
  - If a new document scan is started while another is still running, the log
    will be messed up a bit.
